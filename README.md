# Sanjay Itta Udhyog Management System

## 🚀 Why this project was made
This application was built to digitize the operations of **Sanjay Itta Udhyog**, a brick manufacturing business. Previously, the business relied on manual bookkeeping, which led to:
*   Difficulty in tracking real-time inventory of different brick types (No.1, No.2, No.3).
*   Complex calculations for labor wages and payments.
*   Lack of instant insights into daily sales and expenses.

This **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** solution automates these processes, providing a centralized dashboard for business owners to manage their entire workflow efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Real-time Dashboard
*   **Live Analytics**: View total active labors, monthly expenses, revenue, and cash-in hand at a glance.
*   **Inventory Tracking**: Automatically calculates remaining stock for each brick type (No.1, No.2, No.3) by deducting sales from manufacturing output.

### 👷 Labor Management
*   **Workforce Tracking**: Manage profiles for all laborers.
*   **Payment System**: Track daily work (bricks made), payments given, and calculate "Due" amounts automatically.

### 💰 Sales & Billing
*   **Digital Records**: Record every sale with vehicle number, quantity, and rate.
*   **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor total sales vs. actual received amounts.

### 📉 Expense Tracking
*   **Financial Oversight**: Log all business expenses to keep track of outflow and calculate net profit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **ORM**: Prisma
